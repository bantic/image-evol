      Experiment to compare the speed of shrinking an image with WASM or in
      plain JS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrink algorithm is: iterate through the pixels of the image and
      average contiguous blocks of pixels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timings are logged in the console. Sample results on 2/19/19 for a
      500x500->100x100 shrink:
      <br />
      Shrink with JS takes ~15-25ms (but multiple calls appear to cause Chrome's
      optimizing compiler to kick in, and subsequent shrinks take ~3ms). Shrink
      with WASM takes ~65-75ms.
